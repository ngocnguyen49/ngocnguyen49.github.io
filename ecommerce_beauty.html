      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>The goal of this project was to analyze e-commerce performance metrics such as sales, profit, customer segmentation, and regional trends to derive actionable insights that support business growth.</p>

      <h2>Background Information</h2>
      <p>The dataset included detailed transactional records from an e-commerce platform, covering categories like customer demographics, order quantities, product types, sales values, profits, and shipping data across multiple years.</p>

      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <p>Using Power BI, I imported and cleaned the dataset with Power Query Editor. I ensured data types were consistent, removed duplicates, handled missing values, and created new calculated columns for profit margin and year-based filtering.</p>

      <h2>Dashboard Design and Creation</h2>
      <p>The dashboard was designed with a clean, user-friendly layout to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, top-performing categories, and regional breakdowns. I used clustered bar charts, line charts, slicers, and cards to visualize the trends and comparisons.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This dashboard provided clear insights into product and region-level performance, identifying that Asia Pacific and Europe were top markets in both sales and profit. The corporate segment showed the highest profitability. These insights support data-driven decisions for future marketing and inventory strategies.</p>
